# AgentFlow-Toolkit

AgentFlow-Toolkit — Example AI workflow patterns and agent connectors

This repository demonstrates how to structure and run modular AI workflows that combine language models with developer tools and external connectors. It contains example workflows for repository analysis, document ingestion, and orchestrated agent actions — useful as a starter kit for building production-grade AI automations.

Highlights

Modular workflow definitions for composing LLM-powered agents.

Tool connector patterns (repo file reader, web/document loader, simple tool-call interface).

Example orchestration showing how to chain data ingestion → embedding/search → agent decisions.

# Tech stack (suggested)

Python (core code)

LLM API (OpenAI / Anthropic / similar)

Vector store + embeddings (local or hosted)

Optional orchestrator: lightweight workflow scripts / n8n or equivalent

# Quick start

Clone repo

Create .env with your LLM_API_KEY

python examples/run_workflow.py --workflow repo_analysis
(Replace with the actual script names when you implement.)
